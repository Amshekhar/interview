When a componentâ€™s state or props change, React creates an updated Virtual DOM and compares it to the previous one to identify changes.

Real DOM:
Actual UI representation in the browser
Slower, with frequent re-rendering of the DOM
Entire DOM may re-render on changes
Standard DOM in web browsers

Virtual DOM:
Lightweight JavaScript object representing UI
Updates happen in memory first, then sync with Real DOM
Faster, as only changed parts are updated in Real DOM
Only modified elements re-render, minimizing work
Used by React and similar libraries for efficiency
